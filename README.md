# 3DSolarSystem-GLUT-OpenGL
A real-time, interactive 3D visualization of the inner solar system—featuring the Sun and seven planets—orbiting under realistic relative distances, sizes, and motions. Built with OpenGL, GLUT, and SOIL for texture mapping, this program demonstrates lighting, texture mapping, and simple orbital mechanics in C/C++.
